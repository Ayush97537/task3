# task3
Objective-To implement and understand the basics of linear regression using the scikit-learn library and evaluate the model using common regression metric
The dataset used is a basic house price dataset with columns such as:
Area: Size of the house
Price: Selling price of the house
Steps Performed
1. Import and preprocess data:
Load CSV file
Handle missing values
2. Feature selection:
Area used as the independent variable
Price used as the target variable
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Train the model using Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression
5. Evaluate the model using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Plot actual vs predicted prices
Overlay the regression
